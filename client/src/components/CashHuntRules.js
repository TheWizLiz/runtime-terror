                            <li>Each clue will be a puzzle that will eventually lead you to a specific location on UF campus</li>

                            <li>Within those bags will be a clue, which will lead you to the hiding place of the next clue</li>
                            <li>Once you find the clue, take a photo of it, place it back in its bag, and return the bag where you found it. <b>DO NOT TAKE THE CLUE</b></li>
