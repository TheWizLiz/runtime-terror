                    <p>
                        To ensure the health and safety of our players, our moderators, and our community, Gators Humans vs Zombies has enacted the below safety plan.
                        This plan will be in effect for the Spring 2021 semester, and we will revisit this plan before starting games in future semesters. 
                        Outlined below are the changes to the different aspects of our game.

                    <p>
                        <li>Games are restricted to current UF students who have been cleared to return to campus and non-students who provide negative COVID test results from within a week of the event.</li>
                        <li>Participant limit is capped at 250, including all players and moderators.</li>
                        <li>The game format has been changed to Player vs Player, in which all players use blasters to engage other players from a safe distance.</li>
                        <li>Play is limited to outdoor areas only, with no indoor play or travel during the game.</li>
                        <li>All participants are required to socially distance by six feet or more, and can be asked to leave by moderators if they willfully break this rule.</li>
                        <li>Masks are required for all participants while playing or moderating the game.</li>
                        <li>If a participant needs to remove their mask, they must exit the play area, distance themselves from any bystanders and players by at least 10 feet, and lower or put down their blaster.</li>

                        <li>Moderators are being trained on how to both follow and enforce these safety rules.</li>
                        <li>Special moderators have been assigned as the COVID-19 Safety Coordinator and will ensure, along with the other moderators, that our safety guidelines are being followed and enforced.</li>

                        <li>Game Registration includes name, phone number, email address, and UFID. This information is being kept for 30 days, in case of a positive test case. This is to ensure contact tracing is possible.</li>
                        <li>Rules briefings will be held at the beginnings of events and will go over all general player safety guidelines and game-specific rules for COVID-19 safety. The COVID-19 Safety Coordinator will be identified in these briefings.</li>
                        <li>Players at high risk for severe COVID-19 related health complications are urged not to participate.</li>

                        <li>Players will pick up their bandanas and (if registered for) loaner blasters when they show up to events, after checking in via QR code.</li>
