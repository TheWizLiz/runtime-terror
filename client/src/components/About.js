            Gators Humans vs. Zombies is an outdoor, on-campus game in-which players team up to defeat enemies and complete objectives.
            It is similar to a nerf war; Players complete objectives and take out enemy forces with their blasters while enemies try their
            best to hinder the players. With an immersive storyline that continues throughout each strike this semester, players will be
             faced with harrowing challenges and diverse characters who could be friend or foe. This game is a great way to spend time with 
             your friends, make new ones, relieve stress, exercise, and most importantly, have fun! Will you complete the mission? Will your 
             group make it on to the leaderboard? Only time will tell.
